# TownOfSalem-QualityOfStrings

This is for the Steam version only.

The reversal consists of the following:
- Tavern Keeper and Bootleger have been renamed back to Escort and Consort, and all associated string changes have also been reversed.
- The word "hang" is replaced with "lynch", this change was mostly associated with Executioner and Jester.
- Gender pronouns "he" and "she" are added back.
- Death reasons are changed back to the original ones.
